  # Homebrew has no "zap" for a formula, and could not do this one anyway: what
  # has to be undone is a resolver file, two system services and a trusted root,
  # each reversed from the record written when it was installed. So it is said
  # here, and it has to happen first: afterwards the tool that undoes it is gone.
  def caveats
    <<~TEXT
      Prepare this machine once, then work in any repository with a stack.yaml:

        stack setup
        stack up

      After upgrading, continue using Stack normally. The next command that needs
      the daemon refreshes changed native services automatically. It asks for
      administrative access only when a protected helper actually changed.

      Run stack doctor any time you want to inspect the machine without changing it.

      To remove it, undo the machine changes before uninstalling:

        stack uninstall --purge
        brew uninstall luewell/brew/stack

      --purge also deletes the databases and object storage your projects used.
      Leave it off to keep them.
