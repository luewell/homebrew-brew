  # Homebrew has no "zap" for a formula, and could not do this one anyway: what
  # has to be undone is a resolver file, two system services and a trusted root,
  # each reversed from the record written when it was installed. So it is said
  # here, and it has to happen first: afterwards the tool that undoes it is gone.

    <<~TEXT
      Prepare this machine once, then work in any repository with a stack.yaml:

        stack setup
        stack up

      To remove it, undo the machine changes before uninstalling:

        stack uninstall --purge
        brew uninstall stack

      --purge also deletes the databases and object storage your projects used.
      Leave it off to keep them.
